/**
 * One melee attack: the clip, its blend over the gait, and the warp that aims it.
 *
 * There is one of these per move — the kick (`E`) and the slash hit (`R`) are
 * both instances, differing only in the clip they were handed and the
 * `configKey` they read their numbers from. Anything that has to be true of
 * *an* attack lives here; anything that makes one of them feel like itself is a
 * number in `config/settings.js`.
 *
 * ## Why a warp
 *
 * An attack animation is authored against an imaginary opponent at one exact
 * distance and one exact angle. The player is never standing there. There are
 * only three ways out of that, and two of them are wrong: sliding the body with
 * an ease (which reads as skating), or letting the foot swing through empty air
 * a foot short of the target (which reads as a bug).
 *
 * The third is what every third-person game since about 2013 does, and it is
 * what this class implements: **motion warping**. The target is locked at the
 * moment of the press, the spot the animator assumed the character would be
 * standing on is resolved from it (`standoff` metres short, facing it), and the
 * body is carried onto that spot *inside the clip's own approach* — the frames
 * before the leg comes up. By `hitAt` the character is exactly where the clip
 * needs it to be, so the foot lands on the chest rather than near it.
 *
 * The turn finishes first and the step second (`turnAt`), because that is the
 * order a person does it in: you face what you are about to hit, then you close
 * on it.
 *
 * ## What it owns
 *
 * Not the transform. Like `Jump`, this class only *resolves* where the body
 * should be — `warp` is read by `ThirdPersonController`, which is the one
 * authority over position and heading. And like `Jump`, its clock is the
 * action's own, so the whole move obeys `global.animationSpeed`, the pause key
 * and the hit-stop for free.
 *
 * The contact itself is a callback rather than anything this class acts on: it
 * knows the frame the foot is out, and nothing else about what being hit means.
