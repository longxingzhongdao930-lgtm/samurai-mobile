 * One body: standing, dying, and going away again.

 * field, turning to watch the player. `dead` — the mixer is off and a
 * `Ragdoll` owns every bone, for `corpseTime` seconds. `dissolving` — the same
 * corpse, burning away over `dissolveTime`. Then `gone`, and the manager
 * refills the slot.
 *
 * The handover into the ragdoll is the part worth reading: the animation is not
 * faded out, it is *abandoned* mid-frame, and the solver's first pose is
 * whatever the clip was showing at the moment of the hit. There is no blend
 * because there is nothing to blend — the pose is continuous by construction,
 * which is the only way a death ever looks like it happened to the same body
 * that was standing there.
 *
 * ## Coming apart
 *
 * A blow that `slices` (the slash hit, which comes across with the sword) does not
 * take the path above: the body is duplicated, both copies are handed the same
 * plane and told to keep opposite sides of it, and each gets a ragdoll of its
 * own over the joints its own half actually shows. Two halves, two falls, one
 * skeleton's worth of geometry — and nothing was re-tessellated to do it.
 *
 * The plane lives in **bind** space, not in the posed one. That is the whole
 * trick: a cut measured against the vertex the animator authored stays at the
 * waist however the corpse folds, where a cut measured against the posed vertex
 * would climb the body as it fell and eventually eat it.
 *
 * ## Its look
 *
 * The export carries no textures whatsoever, so the material is authored here
 * rather than imported: a cold near-black body, a fresnel rim (the same device
 * the summoned shadows use, in an ember colour instead of violet) so the
 * silhouette reads against a blue night, and a dissolve that burns the corpse
 * away from the feet up. Every enemy gets its own copy of that material,
 * because the dissolve is per-body — five materials is nothing, and it is what
 * buys each corpse its own clock.
