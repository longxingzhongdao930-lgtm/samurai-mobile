/**
 * What the player can *do*, in one list.
 *
 * Three things read this and nothing else describes a move: `core/Input.js`
 * builds its key map from the entries marked `attack` (so a rebind here rebinds
 * the game), `ui/ActionHUD.js` draws the panels along the bottom of the screen
 * from all of them, and `core/App.js` resolves a state per `id` each frame.
 *
 * `id` is the contract between the three. For an attack it is also the
 * `configKey` its `Attack` instance reads out of `config/settings.js` — one
 * word that names the clip, its tuning block, its glyph in `ui/icons.js` and
 * its chip in the HUD.
 *
 * `category` is the second contract, and it is a statement about *kind*, not
 * about layout: a technique is something the body does with the sword and the
 * feet, an ability is something rarer that the body alone could not. The HUD
 * gives each kind its own panel and its own shape on screen so the difference
 * is visible before either is read — see `ui/ActionHUD.js`.
