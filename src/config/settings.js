  /**
   * `Q` — mark one body, and something on the other side of the world puts a
   * fist through it. See `vfx/Judgement.js`.
   *
   * The move is six beats and they are all in `beats` below: a seal draws
   * itself in the air over the marked body, holds while it gathers, a fist
   * comes down out of it, lands, rests on what is left, and is pulled back up
   * through the way it came. Nothing here is on a physics clock — every beat is
   * a number of seconds, because the whole thing is choreography.
   *
   * ## The three numbers that decide whether it reads
   *
   *  - `height` — how far above the body the seal hangs. It is the length of
   *    the drop, so it is also how heavy the blow looks. Under about two metres
   *    the fist has no room to gather speed and the move reads as a stamp.
   *  - `beats.fall` — how long that drop takes. A quarter of a second is a
   *    *punch*; half a second is a falling boulder. Both work, and they are
   *    different moves.
   *  - `fist.scale` — the size of the thing. At 1.5 the knuckles are wider than
   *    the body they land on, which is the whole joke.
   *
   * ## Why the seal cuts the arm off
   *
   * The fist is a forearm ending in a wrist, and the wrist has to go
   * *somewhere*. It goes into the seal: the material discards every fragment
   * above the seal's plane and burns a line where it crosses (`fist.birth`), so
   * the arm is not a floating prop — it is something reaching through a hole.
   * The arm also stretches to meet that hole however high it is hung, so the
   * two numbers above can be moved without the illusion coming apart. See the
   * shader note in `vfx/Judgement.js`.

   *
   * This is the one ability that is a *mode* rather than a move: while it is up
   * the feet never touch anything, the stick flies the body instead of walking
   * it, and every other move in the game is refused (see
   * `App#_syncAbilities`). That exclusivity is the design — a katana technique
   * thrown from six metres up is a different game, and the answer to "what do I
   * do up here" has to be the thing this ability brings with it.
   *
   * What it brings is the halo. Every body marked from the air (the same aim
   * `V` and `Q` use — `combat/TargetMarking.js`) forges a blade out of the
   * weapon actually on the character's hip, and that blade takes up station
   * around them. They orbit, they charge, and on `Space` the whole set is
   * loosed at once — one blade per mark, each one arriving on its own body a
   * fraction of a second after the last. See `vfx/BladeStorm.js`.
   *
   * ## The three numbers that decide how it feels
   *
   *  - `height` — how far off the floor the body cruises. Under about three
   *    metres it reads as a hover; past six the enemies are ants and the aim
   *    stops being a look.
   *  - `speed` — flying is meant to be *fast*. At the walk's pace the whole
   *    mode reads as the character being stuck in treacle at altitude.
   *  - `blades.chargeTime` — the beat between a mark and a blade being ready.
   *    It is the reason marking six bodies takes a moment rather than being a
   *    button-mash, and it is what makes the volley feel gathered.

   *
   * `inscatter` is the other half, and the one that does the most work per unit:
   * how far the haze goes toward `sunColor` when you are looking down the beam.
   * At 0 the air is a flat wash from every angle; at 1 the quarter of the scene
   * around the moon glows and the rest does not, which is what a long exposure
   * into a full moon actually looks like.
