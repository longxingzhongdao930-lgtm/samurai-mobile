 * Application root: owns every subsystem and the frame loop.

 * The wiring is deliberately one-directional — App builds the systems and then
 * does nothing but order the per-frame updates. No subsystem reaches back into
 * App.
 *
 * What is on screen is a lit stage with a character standing on it: the key,
 * the rim, the air and the grade come from `config/settings.js`, and the body
 * loops its idle. Equipment goes on through the character screen (`Tab`), which is a second
 * scene the same body is moved into — see `screens/CharacterScreen.js`.
 *
 * There are therefore two modes, and exactly one thing switches between them:
 * `characterScreen.active` decides which scene the post pipeline draws, which
 * camera it draws it through, which grade block is in force, and which of the
 * two update paths runs. Neither mode knows about the other.
