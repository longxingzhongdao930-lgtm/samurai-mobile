/**
 * The moves along the bottom of the screen.
 *
 * A read-only HUD: it draws one chip per entry in `config/abilities.js` and is
 * told a state per frame. It knows nothing about what any of them *do* — the
 * app resolves that, because "can this start right now" is already answered by
 * the move itself and duplicating the answer here is how the two drift apart.
 *
 * Each `category` gets its own panel and its own shape, because they are not
 * the same kind of thing and a single uniform row said they were:
 *
 *  - **movement** — one thin plate above the rest, barely there. It is how you
 *    get about, not how you win, and it should not compete with the two panels
 *    that are read mid-fight.
 *  - **techniques** — angular lacquer plates in a row, each an icon over its
 *    name with the key cut into the corner. Three of them, read as a set: this
 *    is the hand the player is playing from.
 *  - **abilities** — a *mon*: a round seal on a ring, standing apart from the
 *    plates on purpose. There is one for now and the panel is built to take
 *    more without changing shape.
 *
 * Three states, and each one says something different:
 *
 *  - **ready** — the key will do something if pressed now.
 *  - **active** — it is happening. The chip lights so the player can see which
 *    of the attacks the body is committed to, which matters while they are
 *    learning that one locks the stick out for longer than the other.
 *  - **off** — pressing the key would do nothing. Nobody is inside the move's
 *    range and cone, or it is switched off in the editor, or its clip failed to
 *    load, or something else has the body. Drained of colour and dimmed rather
 *    than removed: a gap in a row would read as the move being gone for good.
 *    For the techniques this is the common case — the plates come up as you
 *    close on a body and go out as you leave it, which is the row saying what
 *    the rings on the ground say.
 *
 * Writes are diffed against the last state, so the common case — nothing has
 * changed since the previous frame — touches no DOM at all.
