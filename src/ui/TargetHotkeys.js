/**
 * The keys that would land on the body wearing the ring.
 *
 * The ring under a body (`vfx/TargetRings.js`) says *this one is who a press
 * goes to*. It cannot say **which** press, and with two attacks whose ranges
 * differ by more than a metre that is the other half of the answer — a body
 * five metres out is the slash's target and nothing the foot can reach. So the
 * moves that locked it wear their key caps over its head, one per move, lit
 * when the key would actually fire and dimmed when something else has the body.
 *
 * ## Why DOM and not a shader
 *
 * Everything else that marks a body is drawn in the scene, because it is *of*
 * the world — a circle on the ground lies on the ground, a diamond over a head
 * hangs in the air. A key cap is neither: it is the keyboard, quoted back, and
 * it belongs to the HUD along the bottom of the screen rather than to the
 * stage. Drawing it as HTML is also the only way it stays legible at any
 * distance and matches the ability row's own type, which is the whole point of
 * showing a cap instead of an icon.
 *
 * Positioned by projecting the body's head into screen space each frame and
 * moving one absolutely-placed row there. Nothing is created or destroyed while
 * the fight runs: rows are pooled, and each carries a cap per attack from the
 * moment it is built, so a body coming into reach toggles `hidden` rather than
 * building DOM.
 *
 * ## What it owns
 *
 * Nothing but its own fades, exactly like the rings — and they are run off the
 * ring's own `fadeIn`/`fadeOut` so the caps and the circle under them are one
 * gesture rather than two that nearly agree.
