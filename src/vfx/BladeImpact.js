 * What a sword arriving at thirty-eight metres a second looks like.

 * ## Two things out of one buffer
 *
 * A hit is a **burst** — a white core, a ring racing out of it and a star of
 * spikes thrown along the steel — and it is a **shower of sparks** coming off
 * the edge and falling. They are one draw call and one buffer because the only
 * thing that separates them is four numbers and a branch: the burst stands
 * still and animates in the fragment shader, the spark travels and animates by
 * moving. It is the same trick `vfx/DustBurst.js` plays on dust and soil, and
 * the notes there are the ones to read for the machinery — the CPU only ever
 * *births* a sprite (twelve floats into a ring buffer, never touched again) and
 * the trajectory is a closed form evaluated per vertex, because linear drag
 * under a constant acceleration has an exact solution.
 *
 * ## Why the sparks are streaks
 *
 * A spark drawn as a dot at these speeds is a dot: it crosses eight pixels
 * between two frames and the eye reads a stutter. So each one's quad is built
 * in view space **along its own velocity**, stretched by how fast it is
 * actually going — which is a per-particle motion blur for the price of
 * normalising a vec2. It is also what makes the shower read as coming *off* the
 * blade: the streaks all point along the direction the thing was travelling in
 * on the frame it hit, and then bend as gravity takes them.
 *
 * Everything is additive and nothing is lit. This is light, and light does not
 * have a shaded side.
