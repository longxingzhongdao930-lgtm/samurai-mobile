/**
 * The dust and the soil an impact throws up.
 *
 * ## Two populations, one buffer, one draw
 *
 * A ground impact is two materials leaving at once and they behave nothing
 * alike: **dust** is light, slow, enormous and swells as it spreads, and
 * **soil** is dark, fast, small and comes straight back down. Written as two
 * systems they would be two of everything — two buffers, two materials, two
 * draw calls — for a difference that is four numbers. So a particle carries a
 * `kind` and the shader `mix`es drag, gravity, size, growth and colour between
 * the two ends of it. One buffer, one draw, and the two read as different
 * substances because they *are* different substances, not because they are
 * different code.
 *
 * The machinery underneath is `vfx/EmberSystem.js`'s, and its notes are the ones
 * to read: the CPU only ever *births* a grain — twelve floats into a ring
 * buffer, never touched again — and the whole trajectory is a closed form
 * evaluated in the vertex shader, because linear drag under a constant
 * acceleration has an exact solution.
 *
 *   p(t) = p₀ + v₀·(1−e^−kt)/k + a·(t − (1−e^−kt)/k)/k
 *
 * ## Why this one is lit and everything else in the project glows
 *
 * Every other particle system here is additive, because embers, blood mist and
 * arcane light are all things that *emit*. Dust does not. It is a cloud of
 * mineral grains being lit by the moon, and the single thing that separates
 * convincing dust from a grey blob is that it has a **lit side and a shaded
 * side**: each sprite is shaded as a little sphere, its dome normal taken in
 * view space and dotted with the same key direction the world's surfaces use
 * (`frame.uLightDir`). Backlit, the edges brighten instead — which is what
 * happens when you look at a dust cloud with the moon behind it.
 *
 * That is also why the silhouettes are eroded by noise. A soft radial falloff
 * is a smoke puff; the same falloff with a noise field subtracted from it has a
 * torn, billowed edge, and no two grains have the same one because the field is
 * offset by the grain's own seed.
