 * What the ground does when something very heavy lands on it.
 *
 * Two things, on one quad lying on the terrain: a **wave** racing out from the
 * point of impact and decelerating as it goes, and the **cracks** it opens
 * behind itself — radial splits with a wobble in them, each one a different
 * length, glowing along their floor as though the blow had opened something hot
 * under the soil.
 *
 * The order matters and is the whole reason the two are in one shader: a crack
 * only exists *behind* the front. The wave passes, the ground splits in its
 * wake, and the split then cools. Drawn as two separate effects they would
 * appear together and read as a decal fading in.
 *
 * ## Why it is bent rather than placed
 *
 * The quad is subdivided and every vertex is dropped onto the height field
 * (`shaders/lib/terrain.glsl.js`), exactly as `vfx/TargetRings.js` does it. A
 * seven-metre disc laid flat at the impact's own height would be buried on the
 * uphill side and floating on the downhill one — which is the one thing that
 * gives away a ground effect immediately.
 *
 * ## What it owns
 *
 * A small pool and its own clocks. `burst()` claims a slot and `update()` ages
 * it; when a wave is spent its slot goes back. Nothing else in the project
 * knows how long a wave lasts, and nothing here knows what caused one.
