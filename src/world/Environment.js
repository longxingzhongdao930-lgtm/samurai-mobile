/**
 * Scene and lighting.
 *
 * The look is a cinematic stage rather than an outdoor field: a cool key light,
 * a rim from behind, almost no fill. The HDR probe is still loaded, but only as
 * (dim) image-based lighting and as the reflection source for the water / wind
 * shaders — never as the visible sky.
 *
 * The scene carries **no background and no fog of its own.** `world/Sky.js` is
 * drawn over every pixel before anything else, so a background colour was never
 * visible behind it; and `world/Atmosphere.js` owns the air, because it can pool
 * in the hollows and glow looking into the moon, neither of which three's linear
 * fog can do.
 *
 * **The key and the rim light the character, not the world.** three has no
 * per-object light filtering — `WebGLRenderer` gathers lights per *scene* and
 * tests them against the camera's layers, never against the object's — so it is
 * done from the other end: `excludeFromKeyLights` patches a material to drop
 * every directional light, and the key and the rim are the only two directional
 * lights in the scene. The ground takes that patch; the character does not, so
 * the two are lit by different halves of the same rig. See
 * `settings.environment.keyCharacterOnly`, which is live.
 *
 * Note that this also means the key is no longer the *moon*: the moon is a body
 * in the sky with its own angles (`settings.sky.moon`, resolved in
 * `world/Sky.js`), and it is what lights the haze and the mist. The key here is
 * free to be placed for the body alone.
 *
 * Sun shadows use one directional light whose orthographic shadow camera is
 * re-centred on the character every frame and fitted tightly to the play area.
 * At 4096² over a 52 m box that is ~1.3 cm per texel — sharper than a three
 * cascade split would give here, without the cost or the complexity.
 *
 * (An earlier revision used the CSM addon. It replaces three's
 * `lights_fragment_begin` chunk *globally*, which means every material in the
 * scene silently loses all directional lighting unless it is explicitly
 * registered with CSM — a footgun that is not worth it for a play area this
 * small.)
