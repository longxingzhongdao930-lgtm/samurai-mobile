/**
 * The moon, as a body rather than as a dot product.
 *
 * `world/Sky.js` can draw a disc — a smoothstep on `dot(dir, moonDir)` with two
 * octaves of value noise inside it — and for the price (a branch on a fullscreen
 * quad) it is a good disc. But it is a *disc*: it has no terminator, no relief,
 * no silhouette, and the noise standing in for the maria is noise. At the size
 * this scene hangs it at — some six degrees, a dozen times life size, and the
 * subject of the shot — all three of those are visible, and it reads as a lens
 * flare. So this replaces it with a sphere carrying a real lunar surface
 * material, and `Sky` stands its disc down whenever this one is up (`active`).
 *
 * **The maps are a tiling surface material, not a lunar atlas.** They are 1024²
 * squares of ground, so wrapping them on a sphere's own UVs would put a seam
 * down the face and pinch every crater into the poles. They are projected
 * instead — triplanar, in the mesh's *object* space, so the craters are nailed
 * to the body and turn with it, at even scale everywhere including the limb.
 * Three fetches a map, five maps, over a few hundred pixels of screen.
 *
 * **The relief is geometry**, which is the other half of why this exists: the
 * height map displaces the vertices, so the crater rims break the silhouette
 * instead of being shaded onto a circle. The normal map then does the lighting,
 * so the coarse sphere never has to carry the fine detail itself.
 *
 * **On the light.** The moon is not lit from where the scene is lit — the scene
 * is lit *by* the moon. `frame.uLightDir` points from the camera at it, and its
 * own illumination comes from a sun that is somewhere else entirely; that angle
 * is `settings.sky.moon.phase`, measured from full (lit from behind the lens)
 * around toward the limb, which is the only control that decides whether this is
 * a full moon or a crescent.
 *
 * Drawn with the depth test off, just after the sky and before everything
 * opaque, so it is always behind the world and the world always covers it —
 * the same trick, and the same reason, as the sky box itself.
